## Global Visual Style & Aesthetic Direction

**Overall Mood**: Cyberpunk HUD meets Iron Man's JARVIS meets Tron Legacy. Futuristic, authoritative, cinematic.

**Color Palette**:
- **Primary background**: Very dark navy/black (#020408, #0D1117)
- **Primary accent**: Warm gold/amber (#D6A84A) — all wireframes, text, UI elements
- **Secondary accent**: Bronze (#B8743A) — subtle secondary highlights
- **Error/Warning red**: (#EF4444) — used for problems, cracks, failures
- **Success green**: (#22C55E) — used for validated/passing results
- **Cool blue**: (#3B82F6) — architectural/technical elements
- **Purple**: (#8B5CF6) — secondary technical elements

**Visual Elements Present Throughout**:
- **Scan lines**: Subtle horizontal CRT-style scan lines across the screen (very faint)
- **Vignette**: Edges of frame are darkened, focus toward center
- **Floating particles**: Tiny gold/amber dots floating slowly upward, like fireflies or data motes
- **Data rain**: Matrix-style falling gold characters/numbers in the background (subtle)
- **HUD corner brackets**: Animated corner bracket frames around key elements (like a targeting system)
- **Glow/Bloom**: All gold text and wireframes have a soft luminous bloom/glow effect
- **Circuit board patterns**: Subtle circuit-trace patterns in dark areas of the background

**Typography**:
- All text is monospace/tech font (like Courier New or similar)
- Text appears with glow effects — double-rendered with bloom
- Important labels are ALL CAPS
- Numbers use dramatic count-up animations

**Camera Style**:
- Smooth, slow camera movements (Ken Burns-style gentle zooms and pans)
- No jarring cuts — everything flows with cross-fades or zoom transitions
- Depth of field blur on background elements

**Transition Style** (between ALL scenes):
- Cross-fade (1-2 seconds overlap)
- Elements from the current scene can morph/transform into elements of the next
- Never hard-cut to black between scenes — maintain visual continuity

## Narration Voice

**Voice**: Female, professional, warm, confident. Similar to a high-end technology product announcement (think Apple keynote narrator or Siri's enhanced voice).
**Recommended Veo setting**: Natural female voice, moderate pace, clear articulation.
**Tone**: Authoritative but not cold. Confident but approachable. Like a mission briefing from someone who genuinely cares about the technology.

> **NOTE**: Each scene below includes the exact narration text. If Veo supports voice generation, use these scripts verbatim. If generating video without voice, these scripts define the pacing and emotional arc of each scene — time the visual beats to match where key phrases would land.

## ACT 1: THE PROBLEM (~65 seconds)
*Emotional arc: Overwhelm → Frustration → Crisis*

---

### Scene 1.1 — Document Chaos (22 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "Aerospace teams are drowning in documents. Thousands of pages across hundreds of deliverables. Each one could contain a mission-grounding error hidden in plain sight."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
Open on a dark void. From the center of the screen, dozens of wireframe document outlines (glowing gold rectangles with a dog-ear corner fold) explode outward in all directions, tumbling and rotating as they spread across the frame. Each document has faint text lines visible inside it. The documents keep multiplying — 10, then 30, then 100+. Small red warning markers (tiny pulsing red diamonds) blink on random documents.

In the upper-right corner, a HUD-style counter rapidly ticks upward: "DOCUMENTS PENDING: 2,847" — the numbers spin like an odometer.

The camera slowly zooms out as more documents flood the frame, creating a sense of being overwhelmed. The gold particle field intensifies. By the end, the entire screen is filled with floating wireframe documents creating visual chaos.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Dark void, single document appears at center
- 2s: Documents begin exploding outward from center
- 8s: Red warning markers start blinking on documents
- 12s: Counter appears and starts ticking
- 18s: Camera zoomed out, entire frame is document chaos
- 22s: Cross-fade begins into next scene

**PROMPT GUIDANCE FOR VEO:**
"A dark cyberpunk void fills with hundreds of glowing gold wireframe documents exploding outward from the center. Each document is a translucent rectangle with faint text lines and a folded corner, floating in 3D space. Small red warning diamonds blink on random documents. A digital counter in the corner rapidly ticks to 2,847. The scene conveys overwhelming chaos. Dark background, gold wireframe aesthetic, holographic HUD elements, floating particles. Cinematic, 4K, dramatic lighting."

### Scene 1.2 — The Standards Wall (22 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "The standards are endless. MIL-STD-498. DO-178C. IEEE 830. AS9100. Manual review takes weeks and still misses twenty percent of critical issues."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
The chaotic documents from the previous scene begin organizing themselves, flying into formation to create a massive WALL of documents that stretches beyond the edges of the frame. As they lock into place, standard names type themselves onto the document faces in glowing gold text: "MIL-STD-498", "DO-178C", "IEEE 830", "AS9100", "ECSS-E-ST-40C", "ARP4754A".

A slow progress bar appears in the center of the frame, crawling agonizingly from left to right — it's labeled "MANUAL REVIEW PROGRESS" and barely moves. Below it, a red counter climbs: "CRITICAL ISSUES MISSED: 20%" — the "20%" pulses in red.

The camera slowly pans along the wall, emphasizing its endless scale. The documents glow dimly, creating an oppressive sense of an insurmountable task.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Documents begin organizing into wall formation
- 4s: Standard names type onto documents
- 10s: Progress bar appears, barely moving
- 14s: "20%" red counter appears and pulses
- 18s: Camera pan emphasizes wall's endless length
- 22s: Cross-fade into next scene

**PROMPT GUIDANCE FOR VEO:**
"Hundreds of glowing gold wireframe documents arrange into a massive wall formation in a dark void. Standard document names (MIL-STD-498, DO-178C, IEEE 830, AS9100) type themselves onto the documents in glowing gold monospace text. A slow progress bar barely moves across the center. A red pulsing counter shows '20% MISSED'. The camera slowly pans along the wall showing its overwhelming scale. Dark cyberpunk aesthetic, holographic HUD elements, gold wireframe glow, cinematic lighting."

### Scene 1.3 — Breaking Point (21 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "A missed requirement cascades. A defective deliverable ships. The cost to fix grows ten times with every phase. The old way is broken."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
The document wall from the previous scene begins to CRACK. Red fracture lines spread across the wall like glass shattering in slow motion. The cracks glow bright red, branching outward. Documents begin breaking free and scattering as debris — wireframe rectangles tumbling away, leaving voids in the wall.

The entire screen SHAKES subtly (camera vibration effect). The cracks accelerate, the wall collapses. Documents scatter in all directions. The data rain intensifies. Red particles mix with the gold particles.

Everything fades. The debris clears. We're left with a completely dark screen with nothing but a single blinking gold cursor in the center — a thin vertical line pulsing softly. Silence. Anticipation.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: First crack appears in the document wall
- 3s: Cracks spread like shattering glass (red glow)
- 7s: Screen shakes, documents scatter as debris
- 12s: Wall collapses completely
- 16s: Debris clears, screen goes dark
- 18s: Single blinking gold cursor appears at center
- 21s: Cursor holds, cross-fade into next scene

**PROMPT GUIDANCE FOR VEO:**
"A wall of glowing gold wireframe documents begins to crack with bright red fracture lines spreading like shattering glass. The screen shakes as documents break free and scatter as debris. Red and gold particles mix in the chaos. The destruction builds to a crescendo then suddenly everything fades to darkness, leaving only a single blinking gold cursor in the center of a black screen. Dramatic, cinematic destruction, cyberpunk aesthetic, dark background with gold and red glowing elements."

### Scene 2.1 — AEGIS Boot (20 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "Introducing AEGIS. The Aerospace Engineering Governance and Inspection System. Built for classified networks. Zero cloud dependency. One hundred percent air-gapped."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
The blinking cursor from the previous scene expands — it stretches horizontally into a line, then that line draws itself into the outline of a shield shape (the AEGIS logo — a shield/chevron with a golden glow). The shield draws itself stroke by stroke, like a pen tracing the outline, with trailing gold particles following the drawing path.

Once the shield outline is complete, the letters A-E-G-I-S appear one at a time inside or below the shield, each letter arriving with a subtle burst of gold light. The shield fills with a very subtle gold gradient.

HUD corner brackets materialize in the four corners of the screen — animated brackets that slide into position with a mechanical feel. A radar sweep starts in the background — a rotating golden cone emanating from the shield.

The overall feeling is: the system is booting up. Technology is awakening.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Cursor begins expanding into a line
- 2s: Line starts drawing the shield outline
- 6s: Shield outline complete, A-E-G-I-S letters appear
- 10s: Shield fills with golden glow

### Scene 2.2 — HUD Activates (20 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "One hundred and five quality checkers activate. Four extraction strategies. Twelve integrated modules working in concert. The system comes alive."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
The AEGIS shield zooms out to become a central element in a larger HUD display. Four quadrant panels materialize around the shield — transparent gold-bordered rectangles that fade in and populate with scrolling data. A radar sweep rotates behind everything.

A large animated counter appears center-screen and rapidly counts up to "105" with the label "QUALITY CHECKERS" — each digit spins like a slot machine. Below it, smaller counters count to "4 EXTRACTION STRATEGIES" and "12 MODULES".

Gold data streams cascade from the top of the screen — columns of falling characters and numbers (Matrix-style but in gold, not green). The streams flow down and seem to feed into the HUD panels.

The entire scene feels kinetic — everything is moving, activating, coming online. It's like watching a command center power up.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Shield zooms out, HUD panels begin materializing
- 4s: Four quadrant panels filled with scrolling data
- 8s: "105 CHECKERS" counter spins up dramatically
- 12s: Data streams begin cascading from top
- 16s: Full HUD display active, everything in motion
- 20s: Cross-fade into next scene

**PROMPT GUIDANCE FOR VEO:**
"A golden shield logo zooms out to become the center of a futuristic HUD command display. Four transparent gold-bordered panels materialize around it, filling with scrolling data.

### Scene 2.3 — Document Scan (20 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "Drop a document. AEGIS dissects every sentence. Grammar. Compliance. Ambiguity. Acronyms. Over one hundred categories, analyzed in under sixty seconds."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
A single wireframe document descends from the top of the screen into a "scan zone" — a rectangular area outlined with animated HUD brackets. As the document enters the zone, a bright gold horizontal beam sweeps down across it (like a scanner beam), illuminating each line as it passes.

As the beam scans, issue markers FLY OUT of the document — small colored cards or tokens that shoot out to the right side. They sort themselves into a vertical bar chart that builds in real-time. Categories are labeled: "GRAMMAR", "COMPLIANCE", "AMBIGUITY", "ACRONYMS", etc.

A large circular gauge in the bottom-right fills up like a speedometer, landing on a quality score of "87" with a green glow. The number bounces slightly when it arrives (elastic animation).

The scene conveys speed and precision — AEGIS is fast and thorough.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Document begins descending into scan zone
- 4s: Gold scan beam begins sweeping across document
- 8s: Issue markers start flying out to the right
- 12s: Bar chart builds with category labels
- 16s: Quality score gauge fills to 87
- 20s: Cross-fade into next scene

**PROMPT GUIDANCE FOR VEO:**
"A glowing gold wireframe document descends into a scanning zone marked by animated HUD brackets. A bright gold horizontal laser beam sweeps down across the document like a scanner. As it scans, small colored issue markers shoot out to the right, organizing into a bar chart. Categories appear: GRAMMAR, COMPLIANCE, AMBIGUITY, ACRONYMS. A circular quality gauge fills to score 87 with a green glow. Dark cyberpunk void, holographic gold HUD aesthetic, cinematic scanning effects, precision and speed."

### Scene 3.1 — Review Engine (30 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "Seventy-four configurable quality checkers. Grammar, compliance, style, readability, acronyms, cross-references. Every issue deduplicated and severity-graded. Typical review: under sixty seconds."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
A document sits at the center with animated scan rings radiating outward from it (concentric circles pulsing outward like sonar). Around the document, checker categories are arranged in a radial/orbital layout — small labeled nodes ("GRAMMAR", "STYLE", "COMPLIANCE", "READABILITY", "ACRONYMS", "CROSS-REF") that orbit the document.

Lines connect each checker node to the document, with small traveling dots (data packets) moving along the lines toward the document — showing the checkers analyzing.

Below, triage cards slide into view — issue cards being sorted by severity (Critical red, Major orange, Minor yellow, Info blue) into neat columns, like a conveyor belt sorting system.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Document with scan rings emanating outward
- 5s: Checker category nodes appear in orbital layout
- 10s: Connection lines with traveling data dots
- 15s: Triage card sorting begins
- 20s: Counter shows "74 CHECKERS" and "< 60 SECONDS"
- 25s: All cards sorted, scene complete
- 30s: Cross-fade

**PROMPT GUIDANCE FOR VEO:**
"A glowing gold wireframe document at center with sonar-like scan rings pulsing outward. Checker category nodes (GRAMMAR, STYLE, COMPLIANCE, READABILITY, ACRONYMS) orbit the document in a radial layout, connected by lines with traveling gold data dots. Below, issue cards sort themselves by severity into columns (red, orange, yellow, blue) like an automated conveyor system. A counter shows '74 CHECKERS' and '< 60 SECONDS'. Dark cyberpunk HUD aesthetic, holographic gold wireframes, cinematic."

### Scene 3.2 — Statement Forge (30 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "Statement Forge extracts every shall, must, and will statement. Categorizes by directive type. Assigns responsible roles. Compares across document versions to track what changed."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
A document feeds into a funnel-shaped machine at the top of the screen. Colored statement cards emerge from the bottom of the funnel — each card represents an extracted requirement. Cards are color-coded by directive type: blue for "SHALL", amber for "MUST", green for "WILL". They flow outward like a waterfall of cards.

The cards then organize themselves into columns by type. A diff view appears — a split screen showing old version (left, with red strikethrough text) and new version (right, with green highlighted text). Lines connect matching statements across the versions, showing what changed, what was added, what was removed.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Document enters funnel machine
- 5s: Colored statement cards begin emerging
- 10s: Cards flow and organize by directive type
- 15s: Diff/comparison view appears

### Scene 3.3 — Roles Studio (30 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "Every role discovered. Project Manager. Systems Engineer. Quality Lead. A living dictionary built automatically. Adjudication, RACI matrix, inheritance mapping. Zero manual data entry."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
Role labels emerge from a document and form a network/constellation graph — each role is a node with the role name inside. Connections form between roles showing relationships. "Project Manager" → "Systems Engineer" → "Quality Lead" → "Test Engineer" etc.

Kanban-style cards slide in from the right — sorting roles into categories (Active, Pending, Rejected). A RACI matrix grid appears and fills itself in cell by cell — a grid with role names on one axis and responsibilities on the other, cells populating with "R", "A", "C", "I" labels.

An inheritance tree draws itself — showing parent-child role relationships branching downward like an organizational tree diagram.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Role labels emerge from document
- 5s: Network graph of roles forms with connections
- 10s: Kanban cards slide and sort
- 15s: RACI matrix grid appears and populates

### Scene 3.4 — Proposal Compare (30 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "Side-by-side proposal analysis. Financial extraction from any format. Red flag detection per FAR 15.404. Deviation heatmaps. Vendor scores from A through F. All data, no guesswork."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
Two document stacks converge from left and right sides toward a central "comparison engine" — a glowing hexagonal processor. As documents enter, data points fly out.

A tornado/butterfly chart appears — horizontal bars extending left and right from a center axis, showing price comparisons between two vendors. Red flags (small red warning triangles) appear next to anomalous values.

A heatmap materializes — a grid where each cell gradually fills with color from green (below average) through yellow to red (above average), showing cost deviations. Vendor scorecards pop up — letter grade cards (A, B+, C, D) with radar/spider charts behind them.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Two document stacks converge toward center
- 5s: Comparison engine processes documents
- 10s: Tornado chart builds horizontally

### Scene 3.5 — Hyperlink Validator (30 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "Every URL tested. HEAD, GET, SSL bypass, SSO authentication, headless browser for military and government sites. Six thousand links validated with zero false positives."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
A document sits on the left side with small URL markers highlighted throughout it (like little link icons). From each marker, animated lines extend rightward to small globe icons representing destinations. As each connection resolves, the line turns green (working), red (broken), yellow (auth required), or orange (blocked).

A headless browser icon (stylized Chrome/browser outline with a robot face) appears and retests the orange/blocked links, turning many of them green.

A massive counter at the bottom counts up: "6,000 LINKS VALIDATED". A secondary stat shows "0 FALSE POSITIVES" in green.

Status indicator tiles line the bottom: "WORKING: 5,847" (green), "AUTH: 102" (yellow), "BLOCKED: 41" (orange), "BROKEN: 10" (red).

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Document with URL markers visible

### Scene 3.6 — Learning System (30 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "Five learning modules that remember your corrections. Document review. Statement forge. Roles. Hyperlink validator. Proposal compare. Every pattern stored locally. Zero data ever leaves your machine."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
A stylized wireframe brain/neural network sits at center — an abstract brain shape made of connected gold nodes and edges. Five smaller nodes orbit the brain like satellites, each labeled with a module name: "DOC REVIEW", "STATEMENT FORGE", "ROLES", "HV", "PROPOSALS".

Data streams (streams of small gold dots) flow from the satellite nodes INTO the brain, representing corrections being learned. The brain pulses with each incoming data stream — it's growing, learning.

A padlock icon appears at the bottom with the text "ALL DATA STAYS LOCAL" — emphasizing privacy.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Wireframe brain materializes at center
- 5s: Five satellite module nodes appear and orbit

### Scene 4.1 — Stat Cascade (30 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "One hundred and five checkers. One hundred ninety-three API endpoints. Five hundred forty-five audio narration clips. One hundred thirty-seven version releases. Twelve integrated modules. Seven file formats. Four extraction strategies."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
Black screen with subtle gold data rain in the background. One at a time, massive glowing numbers BURST onto the screen — each number is enormous (filling half the frame), arriving with a particle explosion effect:

1. **105** — "QUALITY CHECKERS" (burst of particles)
2. **193** — "API ENDPOINTS" (burst)
3. **545** — "AUDIO CLIPS" (burst)
4. **137** — "VERSION RELEASES" (burst)
5. **12** — "MODULES" (burst)
6. **7** — "FILE FORMATS" (burst)
7. **4** — "EXTRACTION STRATEGIES" (burst)

Each number appears with a dramatic count-up from zero (like a slot machine resolving), accompanied by a label below. As each new number replaces the previous one, the old number shrinks and slides to the bottom of the screen, forming a row of all previous stats in smaller text.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0-4s: "105" bursts on — QUALITY CHECKERS
- 4-7s: "193" bursts on — API ENDPOINTS (105 slides to bottom)

### Scene 4.2 — Architecture Overview (25 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "Pure Flask and vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks. No dependencies you cannot control. SQLite for persistence. Canvas for visualization. Every single line of code serves one purpose."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
An architecture diagram builds itself layer by layer, like a building being constructed from the ground up. Each layer is a horizontal bar that slides in from the left with a different color:

1. **FLASK SERVER** (blue, widest)
2. **ROUTE BLUEPRINTS** (purple)
3. **105 QUALITY CHECKERS** (amber)
4. **NLP PIPELINE** (green)
5. **VANILLA JS FRONTEND** (gold)
6. **SQLITE + LEARNING** (gray)

Vertical connection arrows appear between layers. On the right side of the screen, actual code lines scroll upward in a monospace font — recognizable Python/JavaScript code like `app = Flask(__name__)`, `engine = AEGISEngine()`, `results = engine.review(doc)`.

The code scroll creates a "code waterfall" effect — beautiful, flowing, purposeful.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: First layer (Flask Server) slides in
- 2s: Each subsequent layer appears with 1.5s intervals
- 10s: All 6 layers built, arrows connecting them

### Scene 5.1 — Fortress (25 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "No internet required. No cloud dependency. No telemetry. One hundred ninety-five prepackaged wheel files. Complete offline installation. Your data never leaves the building."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
A hexagonal fortress shape draws itself at the center of the screen — a multi-layered hexagon with glowing gold edges (like a security perimeter). Cloud icons (stylized simple cloud shapes in gray/blue) float in from the edges of the screen but are PUSHED AWAY by an invisible force field emanating from the fortress — they scatter and fade, each getting a red "X" marked over them.

Inside the fortress, a large golden padlock grows — the shackle draws itself, the body fills in, and a gold keyhole glows. The padlock rotates slowly.

Three labels appear across the top: "NO INTERNET" — "NO CLOUD" — "NO TELEMETRY" — each in red, each appearing with emphasis.

A counter at the bottom counts up: "195 OFFLINE WHEEL PACKAGES" — showing that everything needed is self-contained.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Hexagonal fortress draws itself
- 4s: Cloud icons float in, get pushed away with red X
- 8s: Padlock grows inside fortress
- 12s: "NO INTERNET / NO CLOUD / NO TELEMETRY" labels appear

### Scene 5.2 — Classified Ready (25 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "Deployed inside classified enclaves. DoD facilities. Northrop Grumman secure networks. Windows SSO authentication. SharePoint integration. Built for the environments that need it most."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
A network boundary diagram fills the screen. An outer dashed red rectangle represents the "CLASSIFIED NETWORK BOUNDARY" (labeled). Inside, the AEGIS shield sits at the center, connected by animated gold lines to four nodes:
- "WINDOWS SSO" (upper-left)
- "SHAREPOINT" (upper-right)
- "SQLITE" (lower-left)
- "LOCAL FILES" (lower-right)

Each node appears inside its own HUD bracket frame. Data dots travel along the connection lines showing active data flow.

A "CLASSIFIED" stamp appears — tilted slightly, with a thick red border, like a physical rubber stamp being pressed onto the screen. It bounces slightly on impact.

At the bottom, an SSO authentication flow animates: "USER" → "NTLM/SPNEGO" → "AEGIS" → "VALIDATED", with traveling dots showing the auth handshake.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Classified boundary rectangle draws
- 3s: AEGIS shield appears at center
- 5s: Connected nodes materialize one by one
- 10s: Data flow dots travel along connections
- 14s: "CLASSIFIED" stamp smashes onto screen
- 18s: SSO auth flow animates
- 25s: Cross-fade

**PROMPT GUIDANCE FOR VEO:**
"A classified network boundary diagram with a dashed red outer rectangle labeled 'CLASSIFIED NETWORK'. An AEGIS gold shield sits at center, connected to four nodes (WINDOWS SSO, SHAREPOINT, SQLITE, LOCAL FILES) inside HUD bracket frames. Gold dots travel along connection lines. A 'CLASSIFIED' stamp in red appears with impact. An SSO authentication flow animates at the bottom: USER → NTLM → AEGIS → VALIDATED. Dark cyberpunk void, secure network visualization, cinematic."

### Scene 6.1 — Convergence (20 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "Twelve modules. One hundred and five checkers. Five learning systems. One mission. Helping engineers write better documents. Faster. More accurately. Every single time."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
Twelve module icons (small glowing circles with abbreviated names) are arranged in a large circle around the screen's center. They slowly rotate and begin converging INWARD — the circle contracts. Connection lines link each icon to the center.

As the icons converge, the AEGIS shield grows at the center — fed by the approaching modules. The icons merge into a ring around the now-large shield. The ring pulses with golden light.

Then the ring contracts further — all 12 modules converge into a SINGLE POINT OF BRILLIANT WHITE-GOLD LIGHT at the center. The light expands outward in a shockwave effect.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: 12 module icons arranged in large circle
- 5s: Icons slowly converge inward, rotating
- 10s: AEGIS shield grows at center
- 14s: Icons form tight ring around shield
- 17s: Ring collapses into single point of bright light
- 20s: Light expands in shockwave, cross-fade

**PROMPT GUIDANCE FOR VEO:**
"Twelve glowing gold module icons arranged in a large circle slowly converge toward the center, rotating. Connection lines pulse between them. An AEGIS shield grows at the center. The icons merge into a ring around the shield, then collapse into a single brilliant point of white-gold light that expands in a shockwave. Dark cyberpunk void, holographic gold wireframe, convergence visualization, cinematic finale, triumphant energy."

### Scene 6.2 — Logo Reveal (20 seconds)

**NARRATION:**
> "AEGIS. Built by engineers. For engineers."

**VISUAL DESCRIPTION:**
The light from the convergence expands and then resolves into the AEGIS shield at FULL SIZE — the largest it's been in the entire video. The shield is beautifully detailed with golden glow, subtle internal light gradients, and maximum particle density around it (hundreds of floating gold motes creating a field of light).

Below the shield, the title "A E G I S" fades in — large, spaced-out letters with heavy gold bloom/glow.

Below that, the full name: "Aerospace Engineering Governance & Inspection System" in smaller text.

Below that, the tagline in italics: "Built by engineers. For engineers." — appearing with a soft, final emphasis.

The particle field reaches maximum density — the entire frame sparkles with golden particles. Then everything slowly fades to black over the final 4 seconds, leaving the viewer in darkness. End.

**KEY VISUAL BEATS:**
- 0s: Light from convergence resolves into full-size shield
- 3s: Shield at maximum detail and glory
- 5s: "A E G I S" title fades in below
- 8s: Full name appears
- 10s: "Built by engineers. For engineers." tagline appears
- 12s: Particle field at maximum density, everything sparkling
- 16s: Slow fade to black begins
- 20s: Complete black. End.

**PROMPT GUIDANCE FOR VEO:**
"The AEGIS golden shield logo at full size and maximum detail, glowing magnificently against a dark void. Hundreds of gold particles float around it like a field of light. Below: 'A E G I S' in large glowing gold letters, then 'Aerospace Engineering Governance & Inspection System', then 'Built by engineers. For engineers.' in italics. The golden particle field sparkles at maximum density. Everything slowly fades to black. Dark cyberpunk finale, dramatic logo reveal, gold wireframe, cinematic, triumphant, elegant ending."

**Total runtime**: ~7 minutes 30 seconds (450 seconds)

### Tips for Google Veo

1. **Generate scenes individually**: Create each scene as a separate clip (20-30 seconds each), then stitch them together in a video editor.

2. **Consistency across clips**: Mention the visual style in EVERY prompt — "dark cyberpunk void, holographic gold wireframe, HUD aesthetic" — to maintain consistency across scenes.

3. **Audio integration**: If Veo supports voiceover, paste the narration text. Otherwise, generate the voice separately (the 18 MP3 files already exist in `static/audio/cinema/`) and overlay in a video editor.

4. **Cross-fade transitions**: When editing, use 1-2 second cross-fade dissolves between every scene. Never hard-cut.

5. **Background music**: Consider adding subtle, ambient electronic/synthwave music underneath the narration — something dark and atmospheric that builds in intensity through Acts 1-2, sustains through Act 3, builds again in Act 4, and reaches a triumphant peak in Act 6.

6. **Resolution**: Generate at 1920×1080 (16:9) for integration as an HTML5 video player in the AEGIS web app.

7. **Iterative approach**: Start with Act 1 (3 scenes). If the visual style looks right, continue with Acts 2-6 using the same prompt patterns.

These are Microsoft JennyNeural (female) voice clips generated via edge-tts. They can be used as the voiceover track when assembling the final video.

### Integration Plan

Once you have the final .mp4 video file:
1. Place it at `static/video/aegis-showcase.mp4`
2. The existing `technology-showcase.js` will be updated to replace the Canvas animation engine with an HTML5 `<video>` player
3. The existing control bar (play/pause, volume, progress, fullscreen, close) will wire to the video element instead of the Canvas RAF loop
4. The "Behind the Scenes" tile on the landing page will launch the video player
5. No other code changes needed — same entry point, same modal, same controls
