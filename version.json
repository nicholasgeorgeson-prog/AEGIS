        "DIAG: Logs exact encoded paths, API endpoints, file counts, subfolder names, and validation results at every step of the SharePoint library navigation chain",
        "FIX: Defensive URL-decode check in connect_and_discover() — if library_path arrives percent-encoded (e.g., T%26E instead of T&E), decode it before validation",
        "FIX: SharePoint URL detection guard added to ALL 3 folder scan endpoints (sync, async, preview) — previously only the async endpoint had the guard, causing SharePoint URLs to trigger 'Folder not found' errors on the other endpoints",
        "FIX: Deploy scan_history.py with get_statement_review_stats method — resolves repeated 500 errors on Statement History review stats endpoint (5 occurrences in recent logs)",

      "changes": [
        "FIX: CRITICAL — HeadlessSP SSO authentication failure. THREE compounding root causes identified and fixed: (1) chrome-headless-shell (bundled Playwright binary) lacks full SSPI/Negotiate support — now uses system Microsoft Edge (channel='msedge') which ships with Win10/11 and has full Windows Integrated Auth. (2) Playwright's new_context() creates incognito-like ephemeral contexts where Chrome 81+ disables ambient NTLM/Negotiate auth — switched to launchPersistentContext() with temp user_data_dir which creates a regular profile. (3) Added --enable-features=EnableAmbientAuthenticationInIncognito as belt-and-suspenders",
        "FIX: Browser channel priority changed from chrome→bundled to msedge→chrome→bundled. Microsoft Edge is always available on Windows 10/11 and uses the 'new headless mode' (full browser binary with complete networking/auth stack), unlike chrome-headless-shell which is a stripped-down wrapper around Chromium's content module",
        "FIX: User-Agent string updated to include Edge identifier (Edg/131.0.0.0) for proper WiaSupportedUserAgents matching on AD FS servers",
        "ENH: Temp user_data_dir cleanup in close() prevents disk accumulation from browser profiles"

The playwright Python package was present but 'playwright install chromium' was never run, so HeadlessSPConnector.launch() failed with 'Executable doesn't exist'. Apply script now runs 'python -m playwright install chromium' automatically",
        "FIX: Deduplicated auth-server-allowlist entries in HeadlessSPConnector. Identity provider domains were added to both CORP_AUTH_DOMAINS (v6.1.4) and _ensure_browser() extras, causing each domain to appear twice in the Chromium launch args",

        "FIX: CRITICAL — HeadlessSPConnector authentication rewritten for federated SSO (Azure AD + ADFS). Previous version navigated directly to /_api/web which triggered a redirect to login.microsoftonline.us that was immediately detected as 'login page' and returned failure before SSO could complete. Now navigates to site homepage first, waits for full federated redirect chain (SharePoint → Azure AD → ADFS → back), then verifies via page.evaluate(fetch())",
        "FIX: Auth allowlist expanded to include identity provider domains (*.microsoftonline.com, *.microsoftonline.us, *.windows.net, *.adfs.*). The Negotiate/Kerberos challenge happens on the ADFS server during federated auth, not on SharePoint — so the ADFS domain MUST be in --auth-server-allowlist",
        "NEW: SharePoint connector file logging — aegis.sharepoint logger now writes to logs/sharepoint.log (RotatingFileHandler, 5MB, 2 backups). Previously all connector diagnostics went to stdout only, invisible in exported logs",

        "ENH: Detailed SSO failure diagnostics — detects password form (ADFS Windows Integrated Auth not configured), timeout (auth server unreachable), and unexpected URL (wrong redirect). All logged to sharepoint.log",

        "ENH: Transparent auto-fallback — the Connect & Scan endpoint automatically tries the headless browser when REST API auth fails. Frontend is unchanged — user just sees 'Connected' instead of an auth error",
        "ENH: Thread-safe batch downloads — headless connector downloads are forced to max_workers=1 since Playwright sync API is single-threaded. Sequential downloads through one authenticated session still much faster than failing on every file",
        "ENH: Three-strategy file download — Strategy A: fetch() as base64 via page.evaluate, Strategy B: Playwright download API via page navigation, Strategy C: response.body() direct extraction",
